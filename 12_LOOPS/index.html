    <h1> Loops in JS</h1>
     <p> There are 3 types of loops : </p>
        <ul>
            <li> For Loop </li>
            <li> While Loop </li>
            <li> Do While Loop </li>
        </ul>

    <h2> For Loop </h2>
    <p> The for loop is used when you know how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements. </p>
    <p> The syntax of a for loop is as follows: </p>
    <p>
        for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
            // code block to be executed
        }
    
    </p>

    <h2> while loop</h2>
    <p> The while loop is used when you want to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. </p>
    <p> The syntax of a while loop is as follows: </p>
    <p>
        while (condition) {
            // code block to be executed
        }
    </p>
    <h2> do while loop</h2>
    <p> The do while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block will be executed at least once, even if the condition is false. </p>
    <p> The syntax of a do while loop is as follows: </p>       
    <p>
        do {
            // code block to be executed
        } while (condition);    
    </p>
    </body>
