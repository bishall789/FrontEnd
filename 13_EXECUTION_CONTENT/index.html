    <h1> Execution Content in JS</h1>
    <h2>Execution Context</h2>
    <p>Execution context is the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. It contains information about the scope, variables, and functions that are accessible at a given point in time.</p>
    <h2>Execution Stack</h2>
    <p>The execution stack is a stack data structure that keeps track of the execution contexts. When a function is called, a new execution context is created and pushed onto the stack. When the function returns, its execution context is popped off the stack.</p>
    <h2>Global Execution Context</h2>
    <p>The global execution context is the default context in which JavaScript code runs. It is created when the JavaScript engine starts executing the code. In a browser, the global execution context is the window object.</p>
    <h2>Function Execution Context</h2>
    <p>When a function is called, a new execution context is created for that function. This context contains information about the function's parameters, local variables, and the value of 'this'.</p>
